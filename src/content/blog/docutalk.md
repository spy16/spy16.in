## The Problem I Was Trying to Solve

Back in 2022, I was working on some projects and kept running into the same issue - businesses had tons of documentation, FAQs, and knowledge scattered across their websites, but customers still couldn't find answers to simple questions. They'd end up sending emails or calling support for stuff that was literally already documented somewhere.

The obvious solution was chatbots, but most of them sucked. They were either rule-based (brittle and limited) or required manual training (time-consuming and expensive). With LLMs becoming more accessible, I thought: what if we could just point a bot at existing documentation and let it figure out how to answer questions?

That's how DocuTalk started - as an "LLM-based question-answer bot for documentation" (hence the name).

## How It Started

The initial concept was pretty straightforward:

1. User uploads their docs or points to their website
2. System crawls and chunks the content
3. Store everything in a vector database
4. Wire up an LLM to search and answer questions

But as I started talking to potential customers, I realized they didn't just want a documentation bot - they wanted a complete support solution that could also capture leads.

## The Evolution

So DocuTalk evolved into a full support chatbot platform for small and medium businesses. Here's how the final version worked:

### Setup Process

1. **Sign up and create a bot** - Pretty standard onboarding
2. **Point it at your content** - Documents, webpages, landing pages, whatever
3. **Let it crawl and learn** - The platform would automatically crawl, chunk, and store everything in a vector database
4. **Get your embed script** - Just like Google Analytics, you'd get a script tag
5. **Drop it on your site** - That's it, you're live

### What Users Got

Once deployed, visitors would see a little chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of the website. Click it, and they could:

- Ask questions about products, pricing, policies
- Get instant, accurate answers based on the actual documentation
- Request help or more information
- Leave contact details for follow-up

The cool part was that it wasn't just answering questions - it was also qualifying leads by asking about requirements and capturing contact information.

## Technical Stack

Nothing too fancy, but it worked well:

- **Vector database** for document storage and semantic search
- **LLM integration** for natural language understanding
- **Web crawler** that could handle most common content types
- **Embeddable widget** with minimal JavaScript footprint
- **Real-time chat infrastructure** for smooth conversations

The trickiest part was getting the chunking right. Too small and you lose context, too big and the retrieval gets messy. Spent a lot of time tuning that.

## Growing the Business

I managed to grow DocuTalk to around 10 small business customers. Most were local businesses - a couple of SaaS companies, some e-commerce stores, a few service providers.

The best part of this phase was actually talking to customers. I'd hop on calls with them regularly to understand what was working, what wasn't, and what they really needed. These conversations shaped a lot of the product decisions.

One customer ran a small accounting firm and said the bot cut their support emails in half because people could instantly find answers about their services and pricing. Another customer used it primarily for lead generation - the bot would qualify prospects and schedule consultations automatically.

## The Reality Check

Here's the thing though - building the product was the easy part. Marketing and scaling? That's a whole different beast.

I was spending most of my time on product development and customer support, but barely any time on marketing. Growth was slow, and I realized I either needed to:

1. Go all-in on marketing and business development
2. Find someone who could take it to the next level

I chose option 2.

## The Exit

I listed DocuTalk on MicroAcquire (great platform, by the way). Got interest from several buyers, but ended up selling to a marketing expert from the UK who really understood the space.

The acquisition process was pretty smooth. The buyer saw the potential in the core platform and had the marketing chops that I frankly lacked.

Since then, he's rebranded it as [fastbots.ai](https://fastbots.ai) and has grown it significantly. It's pretty cool seeing what it's become. While the core architecture is still there, he's added tons of features and integrations that I never would have thought of.

Sometimes the best thing you can do for your product is find the right person to take it forward.

## What I Learned

Building and selling DocuTalk taught me a bunch of things:

**Product-market fit is everything.** The customers I had really loved the product, which validated that the core idea was solid.

**Customer development is crucial.** Those conversations with early customers were worth their weight in gold. They helped me understand not just what to build, but how to position it.

**Know your strengths.** I'm good at building products and solving technical problems. I'm not great at marketing and business development. Recognizing this early would have saved me time.

**The right buyer matters.** I could have sold to a few different people, but finding someone who actually cared about growing the business (not just acquiring and forgetting) made all the difference.

Seeing DocuTalk thrive under new ownership is honestly one of the most satisfying outcomes I could have asked for. It validates that the technical foundation was solid and reminds me that sometimes the best thing you can do is know when to pass the baton.
