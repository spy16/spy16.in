This is the story of DocuTalk—a chatbot I built just as LLMs were starting to take off, during my "try every SaaS idea" indie-hacker phase.

Honestly, I just wanted to do something cool with LLMs. I spend a ton of time digging through docs for different programming languages, libraries, and tools, so making it easy to ask questions to documentation felt like an actually useful first idea. Whipped up an MVP: point it at your docs or site, it crawls, chunks, and answers stuff using LLM magic. Felt like a win.

But then I realized: why stop at docs? Business support is a massive hassle, especially if you're a small biz and don't have someone to answer every "what's your pricing?" or "how do I reset my password?" sort of question. Rebranding it for business support turned out to be a great move—instant answers for customers, less work for owners, win-win.

At one point, I casually dropped a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12n2hso/building_a_tool_to_create_ai_chatbots_with_your/) about DocuTalk—didn’t think much of it. Suddenly it totally blew up: over a million views, more than 2,500 likes, and something like 1,000 comments. Tons of folks were super interested and the traffic spiked, but the platform was brand new, still had a bunch of rough edges, and didn’t even have payments hooked up yet.

Funniest part? I started DMing everyone who asked for an invite link in the comments… and Reddit promptly blocked me for “spamming” 😂. Meanwhile, a bunch of other builders making similar chatbots started hijacking my post, sneaking their own links into the replies to anyone who showed interest. Annoying, but honestly kind of hilarious to watch.

But to be honest, I didn’t get much conversion from that Reddit post. What it did help, though, was to surface a bunch of kinks that needed fixing in the platform—and give me some user data about how people explored the product.

Over time, I also added Microsoft Clarity to see how users were actually interacting with things. Watching recordings made it super clear: after creating a bot, people were just being dropped into the control panel with zero guidance on what to do next—so they'd aimlessly move their mouse around, get confused, and leave. So I switched onboarding to a step-by-step wizard (create bot → train bot → customize → embed script), and conversion rates shot up after that.

Best part? Random emails/calls from early users, sharing wild ways they were using their chatbots. Those chats drove most of the product improvements.

After all this excitement, growth started slowing down. It was just hard for me to keep pushing it. I’m honestly not good at marketing—I tried posting on random subreddits, Quora forums, and other places, but nothing really worked.

I really did want to do the whole build-in-public thing and grow an audience, but being an introvert, putting myself out there in public felt nearly impossible. Plus, over time, I was getting bored of making only small improvements. I missed the thrill of building something totally new from scratch.

So I decided maybe it was time to let someone else take over, use any money from selling DocuTalk to fuel my next project or idea. Luckily, someone who’s great at marketing picked it up, rebranded as [fastbots.ai](https://fastbots.ai), and actually grew it much more than I could have doing it solo.

Not every project needs to be a rocketship. DocuTalk made life easier for a bunch of people—and is still running strong as [fastbots.ai](https://fastbots.ai). That’s a W in my book.

### Lessons Learned

- Use your strengths shamelessly: tech, marketing, or whatever — double down on what you’re good at. 💪
- Big viral spikes are cool 🚀, but product friction kills conversions fast. 🪤
- Measure everything: observe user interactions, talk to users, you can’t improve what you’re not measuring. 📊🕵️‍♂️
- If you get bored or hit a wall, it’s okay to move on and try something new. 🏃‍♂️
- Sometimes passing the baton is the best move for the product and for yourself. 🏅
